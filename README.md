# Multi-Branch CNN Copy Move Source-Target Disambiguation

This repository is an implementation of the method in 

"Copy Move Source-Target Disambiguation through Multi-Branch CNNs" 
Mauro Barni, Quoc-Tin Phan, Benedetta Tondi

The disambiguation method allows to identify source and target region of a copy-move by means of a multi-branch 
CNN-based architecture, capable to learn suitable features by looking at the presence of interpolation  artifacts 
and boundary inconsistencies.
